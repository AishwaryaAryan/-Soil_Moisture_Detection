IoT-Based Soil Moisture Detection Using ESP8266

Overview

This project measures soil moisture levels using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and a soil moisture sensor. The data can be used for smart irrigation systems to prevent overwatering or underwatering.

Components Used
ESP8266 NodeMCU
Soil Moisture Sensor
Jumper Wires
Circuit Connections

Code Explanation
Reads soil moisture data from the sensor.
Displays the readings on the Serial Monitor.
Can be extended to trigger an automatic watering system.

Installation & Usage

1. Connect the components as per the circuit
2. Upload the code using Arduino IDE
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view real-time soil moisture levels

Applications

✅ Smart irrigation systems
✅ Precision agriculture
✅ Home gardening automation
